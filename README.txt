What is it: 
It is a Guess the Number game.

What does it do: 
Generates a random number from 1-100 and asks the user to guess. After each guess, the user is told whether their guess was too high or too low, and they get to guess again, up to 10 guesses.


How does it work: 
User first provides a name for the game. User then is prompted to “take a shot” and make a guess. If guess is too high, it tells the user it’s too high. If the guess is too low it tells the user it’s too low. If guess is the same as the randomly generated correct number, a congratulations message is created using the name provided, also giving the number of guesses used.
